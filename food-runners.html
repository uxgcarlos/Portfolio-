We then synthesized our research by utilizing affinity mapping that allowed us to spot tends in our data. From our research we learned a few key insights about our users. From there we developed our main key persona that we designed for. </p>

        <h2> Wire Frames</h2>
        <h3> Designing Fast With Purpose</h3>
        <p>Once we built a strong research foundation we then started our first initial redesign of Food Runners website. Once we had our low-fi wireframes we then conducted usability testing. Conducting usability testing at an early stage was very beneficial for our design process because it provided us with great insights on what features to actually implement in our design. </p>

                        <li>The placement of page titles did not convey the sense of a new page </li>

                                <p>Since Food runners current website did not have any clear call to action we included two main call to actions on the landing screen. By having a clear call to action it will grab the users attention and let them know what they should be focusing on. As for color since food runners branding is red we really wanted to choose a color that compliments red and also entails the feeling of encouragement. This would also encourage user to contribute to the cause which satisfies both the user and organization needs</p>
