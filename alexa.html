Due to that I focused on designing an app and building an interactive prototype while my other two teammates focused on building the algorithm for the product. </p>

                                <li> I gave the users an option to customize how open they wanted their window. For this I designed a <span class="bold">slider that would have three pre determined options (Closed, Half way open, and Fully open). This feature gives the users flexibility on how open they want their windows while also not being too overwhelming. </span></li> 
                                 <li> I explored an idea that would give the user <span class="bold">tips and ways to put their product to best use </span>.  This would have tips on when to open their windows to achieve maximum energy conservation while also cooling their house.  </li>
                             </ul>
