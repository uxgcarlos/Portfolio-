                        <p>Once we built a strong research foundation we then started our first initial redesign of Food Runners website. Once we had our low-fi wireframes we then conducted usability testing. Conducting usability testing at an early stage was very beneficial for our design process because it provided us with great insights on what features to actually implement in our design. </p>
